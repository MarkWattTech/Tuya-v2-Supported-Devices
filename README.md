&nbsp;

## How To Submit PBT Products
<p> Their are <b>3</b> ways you can submit a PBT issue.</p>

* <a href="mailto:markwatttech@gmail.com">Email Me</a> the product you want adding with all of the needed info (see below)
* <b>Create a pull request</b> directly adding your product - <a href="https://github.com/MarkWattTech/Tuya-v2-Supported-Devices/compare">Create PR</a>

<p> Creating an issue with the New PBT Product Template will be the quickest. You will just need to enter the needed info and press submit.</p>
&nbsp;

## Needed Information
<p> When making a submission please include : </p>

* First Class Category
* Manufacturer
* Device Model
* Category
* Category Code
* Product Link(s)
* Short description of product
* Link to image of product

<p> In the submission you can also fill the infor directly to the html row.</p>
<p><b>(I may automate the process and have something pull the issue and add it to the document in the future so this would be handy).</b> </p>

## What is a PBT Product?
<p> A PBT product is a <b>"Powered By Tuya"</b> product. It is a product that utilizes the Tuya Cloud service and can usually be identified by the Tuya logo or Powered by Tuya Logo (sometimes this logo is only on the packaging of a product).</p> If it uses the Tuya Cloud, it's PBT!

&nbsp;
<p> Below is an example of the HTML table row info which is in the New PBT Product Template.</p>

```html
<tr>
      <td>First Class Category</td>
      <td>Manufacturers name</td>
      <td>The model for device (if applicable)</td>
      <td>Category of device</td>
      <td>Device category code</td>
      <td>Link(s) to where you can get the product/</td>
      <td> Short description of the product</td>
      <td>A link to an image of the product</td>
    </tr>
```

# About This Project
## What is this Project ?
<p>It's just a place to capture PBT product that are working with Tuya-v2 and Home Assistant to help user check if their devices are compatible, and also to help with buying new devices. The idea is to just list all Tuya devices that are currently working with the v2 integration and Home Assistant.</p>

&nbsp;

## What it isn't
<p>It's not a place to report issues with devices. If you have a PBT device that's not working or isn't yet compatible, you should open an issue on the Official Tuya-v2 GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/tuya/tuya-home-assistant" target="_blank">here</a></p>
</br>

## Why is it on GitHub?
<p>I'm currently working on my New Website which I will port this all over too in the future. But for now Git will work well for just simply displaying a list of different products, and allowing users to contribute to the list. When my site is ready I will link to it on this project.</p>
</br>

## Is this supported by Tuya?
<p>I have been speaking to Tuya about creating something like this. Initially a <a href="https://github.com/tuya/tuya-home-assistant/discussions/309" target="_blank">Discussion</a> was created on the official Tuya-v2 Git, but it didn't really take off. I suggested a page sort of like this, and Tuya was happy for me to create this and they would direct to it.</p>

<p> Tuya-v2 is a new Home Assistant integration designed to replace the existing Home Assistant Tuya integration. It utilizes Tuya's new API and supports lots more product and features.

## Why am I making this?
<p> I have a passion for smart home and tech and enjoy helping others. It's not everyday a big tech company decideds to dedicate resources to developing an integration for an open source project with the help of the community, and I just wanted to be part of this and to help make the integration the best it can be. I also started off my Smart Home journey with some simple Tuya devices and prior to using HA I was writing my own tools that used Tuyas API to do things like turn my lights on and off. </p>
